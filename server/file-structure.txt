node_modules/: Contains all the npm packages installed for your project.

src/config/:

dbConfig.js: Holds the configuration for your PostgreSQL database connection. This might include settings like database name, user, password, and host, often loaded from environment variables.
src/controllers/:

userController.js: Contains functions that handle incoming requests and return responses to the client, typically interacting with models to retrieve or modify data.
src/models/:

userModel.js: Defines the structure of your database tables in terms of your ORM. For example, with Sequelize, you define models that map directly to tables in your PostgreSQL database.
src/routes/:

userRoutes.js: Defines the endpoints of your application and maps them to controller functions.
src/middleware/: Contains middleware functions for tasks like authentication, logging, or error handling.

src/utils/: Holds utility functions that can be used throughout the application for various tasks, such as data formatting or validation.

src/db/:

migrations/: Contains migration scripts that allow you to manage your database schema changes. Migrations are especially useful for keeping track of changes in the schema and applying those changes across different environments.
seeds/: Contains seed scripts to populate your database with initial data for development, testing, or production.
.env: Stores configuration in the environment variables, such as database connection details, which should not be hard-coded into your application's source code for security reasons.

app.js: The main file that starts your Express server and sets up middleware, routes, and database connections.
